I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/) of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz in the group of [M치ria Luk치cov치-Medvidov치](https://www.numerik.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/prof-dr-maria-lukacova-medvidova/).
My research is focused on the analysis and development of numerical methods for partial differential equations. 
In particular, I am interested in the stability of these schemes as well structure-preserving techniques, allowing to unify the analysis of the continuous and the discrete level.
