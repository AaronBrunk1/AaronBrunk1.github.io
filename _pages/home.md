I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz in the group of Maria Lukacova.

My research interests are:

* Existence of suitable solutions for nonlinear PDEs using energy/entropy motivated methods.
* Conditional uniqueness and stability of such solutions using relative energy/entropy arguments.
* Long-time behavior and regularity of solutions to such PDEs.
* Structure preserving space and time discretisations.
* Rigouros error analysis using relative energy/entropy methods for discrete solutions.
