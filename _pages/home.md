I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Institute of Mathematics](https://www.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/) of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz in the group of [M치ria Luk치cov치-Medvidov치](https://www.numerik.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/prof-dr-maria-lukacova-medvidova/).

My research interests are:

* Existence of suitable solutions for nonlinear PDEs using energy/entropy motivated methods.
* Conditional uniqueness and stability of such solutions using relative energy/entropy arguments.
* Long-time behavior and regularity of solutions to such PDEs.
* Structure preserving space and time discretisations.
* Rigouros error analysis using relative energy/entropy methods for discrete solutions.

The system I typically study are motivated from the fields of soft matter physics, fluid dynamics or material engineering.
